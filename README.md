Edit Reservation: Passengers can edit their reservation details, including personal information, flight, departure, destination, and seat type.

View and Delete Reservations: Passengers can view their reservation details, and there's an option to delete their reservations.

Data Storage: Passenger data is stored in an array of Member objects, and the code allows for multiple passengers to be recorded. The program offers an interface to view all passenger data and reservations.

Login and Exit: The program begins with a login screen and can be exited by selecting the "Exit" option from the main menu.

Error Handling: The code includes error handling for incorrect inputs and provides feedback to the user.

Loading Animation: A loading animation is displayed when transitioning between screens, giving a user-friendly visual experience.

Color and UI: The program uses system commands to change text and background colors to enhance the user interface.

Overall, this code represents a simple airline reservation system that allows passengers to make, view, edit, and delete reservations while managing flight schedules and passenger data.
